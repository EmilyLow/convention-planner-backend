## Schedule Endpoints

`GET` /schedules/

`GET` /schedules/:id

`GET` /schedules/:id/events

`DEL` /schedules/:id/events

### Schedule Schema

id=[integer]  
schedule_name:[String]  
personal_schedule:[boolean]  

Example:

```
{
  "id": 2,
  "schedule_name": "Talks",
  "personal_schedule": 0
}
```

## Event Endpoints

`GET` /events

`GET` /events/:id

`PUT` /events/:id

`POST` /events/:id

`DELETE` /events/:id

### Event Schema

id: [integer]  
schedule_id: [integer]  
event_name: [String]   
start_time: [String] Format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"  
end_time: [String] Format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"  

Not required:  
speaker: [String]  
summary: [String]  
location: [String]  
color: [String]  
start_col: [int]  
span: [int]  

Note: 
start_col and span are usually generated by the placement algorithm. However, in some instances it is useful to be able to specify them. For example, you might want the most important event to come first, in a series of events that take place at the same time, or you might want to give an important event a greater percentage of horizontal space than it would be automatically alloted. 

Example:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "schedule_id": 1,
  "event_name": "Bus Tour 1",
  "speaker": "",
  "summary": "Tickets $15",
  "location": "Departs from the Providence Visitor Information Center, 1 Sabin St.",
  "start_time": "2019-08-22T18:30:00.000Z",
  "end_time": "2019-08-22T20:00:00.000Z",
  "start_col": 2,
