    "summary": "It's safe to say that without the tireless work of August Derleth, so much weird fiction (and, indeed, Lovecraft himself) may have been lost to the mouldering graveyard of pulp obscurity. When he and Donald Wandrei decided to begin the Arkham House project in 1939 by releasing what they saw as the best of Lovecraft's work to the public, the field was irrevocably changed. Please join us as we discuss how it all began, where it all went, and the vast shadow that remains over weird fiction.",
