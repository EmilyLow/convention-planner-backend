        summary: "Lovecraftesque is the GM'less storytelling game of brooding cosmic horror you’ve been waiting for. You tell the story of a lone Witness at the mercy of strange and terrifying events. The game helps you create a slow-building mystery, culminating in a climactic scene of horror. You create your own monsters and mystery that feel like something out of Lovecraft’s notebook. All the players contribute clues to surprise and creep each other out. The rules ensure that the story flows seamlessly, as if an invisible GM were guiding it. There won’t be any Mi-Go or Deep Ones—a fresh take on the genre.",
