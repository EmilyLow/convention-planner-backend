Were his political affiliations in the bitter race for Arkham’s next Mayor somehow a factor in his death? Or is the closely held secret to Reinhart Cigarettes’ distinctive green-smoking tobacco something that a rival company might be willing to kill to find out?",

The strange affliction leaves victims covered in disgusting yellow scabs; almost everybody has shown some signs of infection. To everyone’s great dismay the harbourmaster at Sydney has refused to allow the ships to land, placing the convoy under quarantine. \n But … not everyone seems willing to wait for permission to land. Last night both ships were awoken by a terrible ruckus which ended with a solitary figure falling into the water, apparently hell-bent on swimming the last miles to Sydney Town. The strange thing is … the man who was seen paddling into the distance as though he had the devil at his heels was a frail old priest – and blind!
