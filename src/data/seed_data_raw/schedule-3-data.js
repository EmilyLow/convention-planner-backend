Their tagline (“To Achieve Greatness One Must Smoke Green!”) is fitting, as the cigarettes produce a faint but distinctive, bilious green smoke. It is also appropriate because many of the loyal Reinhart smokers believe that their choice of cigarette brings them good fortune. Despite a thriving demand for their product, all is not well for Reinhart Tobacco. When company president Reinhart Laine is found dead in his luxury high-rise office, the Investigators are charged with discreetly looking into the matter. \n Who could have wanted the wealthy tycoon dead? Were his political affiliations in the bitter race for Arkham’s next Mayor somehow a factor in his death? Or is the closely held secret to Reinhart Cigarettes’ distinctive green-smoking tobacco something that a rival company might be willing to kill to find out?",

Play for as little as 10 minutes, or enjoy the whole 3 hour ride. Great for first time players as we run a simplified version of the game and basically anything goes.

Three villages of native Britons suddenly abandon their homes and head towards the city of Eboracum (modern day York). The investigators must investigate this refugee crisis and get these people back to their homes, before their crops die or famine will devastate the region come winter.
